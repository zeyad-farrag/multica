// State machine for translating GitHub PR / review events into Multica issue
// status transitions.
//
// The machine is intentionally a pure function: given an Input, it returns a
// Decision. The webhook handler is responsible for I/O (loading the issue,
// querying review state from GitHub) and for applying the Decision.
//
// Status vocabulary: backlog, todo, in_progress, done, blocked, cancelled,
// planning, ready_for_dev, code_review, fixing, testing, coderabbit,
// resolving, staged.
//
// CR-resolution flow — coderabbit ↔ resolving loop, APPROVED is the sole
// path out:
//
//   testing      → coderabbit   (Marcus dispatched: publish PR; CR reviews)
//   coderabbit   → resolving    (CR submitted review with unresolved threads)
//   coderabbit   → staged       (CR APPROVED — sole path to staged)
//   resolving    → coderabbit   (sidecar marker after Marcus republishes)
//
// Status transition table (this file owns only the GitHub-driven edges):
//
//   Event                                              From            To
//   ---------------------------------------------------------------- ------------
//   pull_request.opened                                pre-coderabbit  coderabbit
//   review.submitted state=changes_requested (CR bot)  coderabbit      resolving
//   review.submitted (CR bot) + LocalUnresolvedCount>0 coderabbit      resolving
//   review.submitted state=approved (CR bot) + clean   coderabbit      staged
//   review.submitted state=commented + clean           coderabbit      noop  (race guard)
//   pull_request.closed merged=true                    coderabbit      staged → done (chained)
//   pull_request.closed merged=true                    staged          done
//   pull_request.closed merged=false                   any             blocked
//   pull_request.reopened                              blocked|done    coderabbit
//   pull_request.synchronize                           any             noop (sidecar drives bounce-backs)
//
// Two invariants the table enforces:
//
//   1. APPROVED-only-→-staged: only an explicit CR APPROVED review event
//      can autonomously promote an issue to staged. Thread-resolved events
//      draining the local count to zero are NOT a "CR approved" signal —
//      they are Marcus's own /resolve calls, and reacting to them would
//      violate the "ONLY APPROVED → staged" rule.
//
//   2. Race guard for COMMENTED reviews: GitHub delivers
//      `pull_request_review` ahead of the inline
//      `pull_request_review_comment` events. handleReview's bulk-mirror
//      pulls the review's comments via REST before Decide is called, so
//      LocalUnresolvedThreadCount reflects the full set on the original
//      review event. The per-comment re-eval in handleReviewComment is the
//      fallback when bulk-fetch fails. If both fail, the cr-settle sweeper
//      rescues stuck `coderabbit` issues after MULTICA_CR_SETTLE_SECS.
//
// Anything not listed above is a no-op (Decision.Action == ActionNoop).
//
// Synchronize is intentionally noop. The CR-resolution loop is driven by
// review events and sidecar markers, not by raw push events.

// Action is what the webhook handler should do as a result of an event.
